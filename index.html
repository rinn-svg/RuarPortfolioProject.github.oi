            Hi, welcome to my portfolio! I'm Avie Ruar, a dedicated student pursuing my 
        course. On this site, you'll find projects I've worked on, expiririence
        I've completed, and skills I’ve developed throughout my academic journey. My goal is to
        constantly learn and grow, and I’m excited to share my work with you. Feel free to explore
        my projects and contact me if you’re interested in learning more about my experiences</p>
        
        <p>I hope you can relate to my hobbies and interest I'm so excited to share my expirience
        also i hope you find it interesting, as a student who love to do not so many things and the
        life I'm unsure in future. 
        </p>
